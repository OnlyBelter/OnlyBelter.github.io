Here, we developed the first web server, namely, MetCCS Predictor, for predicting CCS values. It can predict the CCS values of metabolites using molecular descriptors within a few seconds. Common users with limited background on bioinformatics can benefit from this software and effectively improve the metabolite identification in metabolomics.

Main contribution: I designed and created the whole website which can predict CCS values by R package and query CCS values by MySQL from backend. I also designed the logo of this program.
