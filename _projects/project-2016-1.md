I participated this project when I worked in Zhu lab in IRCBC during 2016 to 2018. 
At the beginning, I cooperated with another colleague (Zhiwei Zhou) 
and my main contribution was 2 user-friendly web server ([MetCCS](http://www.metabolomics-shanghai.org/MetCCS/) and [LipidCCS](http://www.metabolomics-shanghai.org/LipidCCS/)) about CCS prediction and database search. 
In the last period of this project, 
I was one of the main contributors of the machine-learning-based prediction algorithm ([Nat Commun, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18171-8)). 
I also designed the logo for LipidCCS and MetCCS website.
