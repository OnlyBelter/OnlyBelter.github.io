I joined in this project when I came to Li lab in SIAT. 
I cooperate with another colleague and mainly focus on the deconvolution of bulk cell RNA-Seq data from tumors 
and try to figure out the relation between some specific gene expression programs (such as EMT) and immune cell abundance in tumor microenvironment.
