I attended this project when I joined in Chen Lab in SUSTech. 
I was mainly focus on designing sgRNA library which contains 3 kind of different sgRNAs 
for targeting the essential genes in mouse-rat fusion cells ([Li et al., 2016, Cell](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.11.035)). 
The challenge of this work is that essential genes are highly conserved between mouse and rat 
and the sequences of each gene in these two species are very similar. 
So to find a good strategy to get enough allele-specific sgRNAs that can target only one species is the key point.
