To analyze regulatory relation of miRNA, lncRNA, transcript factor (TF) and target gene in an integrated way, 
we employed biological interaction network to represent and visualize these regulatory relations. 
Feed-forward loop (FFL) is a kind of small regulatory network (motif) which is comprised by 3 nodes (miRNAs/lncRNA, TF and target gene).
FFL may show some specific regulatory relation in biological network ([Shen-Orr SS et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng881)).
We developed an algorithm to search FFLs from big network efficiently and a tool to visualize FFL.
And we applied a Chinese patent for this achievement (I am the first inventor), [https://patents.google.com/patent/CN103870876B/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN103870876B/en).
