To analyze regulatory relation of miRNA, lncRNA, transcript factor (TF) and target gene in an integrated way, 
we employed biological interaction network to represent and visualize these regulatory relations. 
Feedforward loop (FFL) is a kind of small regulatory network (motif) which is comprised by 3 nodes (miRNAs/lncRNA, TF and target gene).
FFL may show some specific regulatory relation in biological network.
We developed an algorithm to search FFLs from big network efficiently and a tool to visualize FFL.
And we applied a Chinese patent for this achievement, [https://patents.google.com/patent/CN103870876B/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN103870876B/en).
