Welcome! I am a Research Assistant in the [Shenzhen Institute of Synthetic Biology](http://isynbio.siat.ac.cn/) at Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, CAS in Shenzhen, China. 
I am also a graduate student majored in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). My advisor is [Prof. Hai Zhao](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~zhaohai/index.html) and I am going to require my master degree in the spring of 2021. 

After I earned my BEng in Bioengineering from [Xi'an Polytechnic University](https://www.xpu.edu.cn/). 
I worked at [Genminix](http://www.gminix.com/) (a biotech company) as a developer of new tools for bioinformatic analysis. 
I went to [ZhuLab](http://www.zhulab.cn) at [Interdisciplinary Research Center on Biology and Chemistry](http://ircbc.ac.cn/) as a Research Assistant in 2016 and I also started my study as a master student (part-time) at SJTU this year. 
Cooperating with other colleagues, 
I published several papers ([Zhou Z, Xiong X, Zhu Z J., Bioinformatics, 2017](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/2235/3066291);
                             [Zhou Z, Tu J, Xiong X, et al., Analytical chemistry, 2017](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02625);
                             [Shen X, Wang R, Xiong X, et al., Nature communications, 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09550-x);
                             [Zhou Z, ..., Xiong X, et al., Nature communications, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18171-8)) related to data analysis of Bio-Mass Spectrometry.
I am one of the main contributors of the machine-learning-based prediction algorithm for the last article.
