As a firm adherent of lifelong learning, I really appreciate that [MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) became available for almost everyone since 2012.

Biology, computer science and math are the top 3 subjects of my favorite. Bioinformatics is an interdiscipline associated with these three subjects. 
MOOCs give me a wonderful platform to construct the foundation of my knowledge network systematically.

The first course I finished at Edx taught by Eric S. Lander from MIT: *[7.00x: Introduction to Biology - The Secret of Life](https://verify.edx.org/cert/f12b9f27643248faa1debf7569ecad35)* in 2013.

Since then, I learned the following courses at Edx and Coursera.

### Programming
- [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python](https://www.coursera.org/api/legacyCertificates.v1/spark/statementOfAccomplishment/972072~4685733/pdf) (Rice University at Coursera, 2014) 
- [6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://verify.edx.org/cert/16519db68d754ebfb96bc26cd9accfe4) (MITx at Edx, 2015)
- [6.00.2x: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/2ab8b4b71ae04baeacd292bbee9f3723) (MITx at Edx, 2015)


### Machine Learning and Data Science
- [DSE220x: Machine Learning Fundamentals](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/803fb8929d2346fda968f595f3434f70) (UCSanDiegoX at Edx, 2018)
- [6.431x: Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/2f20225598f443449f054b231215018b) (MITx at Edx, 2019)
- [18.6501x: Fundamentals of Statistics](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/c39c7ebe31fd4d0490aed8b176dd5de8) (MITx at Edx, 2020)
- [6.86x: Machine Learning with Python-From Linear Models to Deep Learning](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/c64399d4c9aa43a69495832e1d62cf78) (MITx at Edx, 2020)

*[MicroMasters Program in Statistics and Data Science](https://micromasters.mit.edu/ds/)* provided by MIT at Edx needs to finish 3 core courses, 1 elective course and a final capstone exam. I have finished 3 core courses ([record](https://credentials.edx.org/records/programs/shared/44e27b0247604104b1e99c5953f8111f/)) and I am going to take the last course and final exam in the next round.

*18.6501x: Fundamentals of Statistics* is the hardest course I have ever taken since I became a student. But I really learned a lot under the outstanding teaching of Prof. Philippe Rigollet and the help of TAs.
There was an very interesting episode on the discussion board during this course (please watch movie *[Good Will Hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Will_Hunting)*):
